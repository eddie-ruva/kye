### Getting started

1. Install dependencies, mainly just gulp stuff for a local server, sass compiling, autoprefixer and js minification.

  ```
  npm install
  ```

2. After dependencies are installed successfuly run the default gulp task which will boot up the server.

  ```
  gulp
  ```
  
3. Server should now be running on port `8080`, go to `localhost:8080` and you will see the page.
